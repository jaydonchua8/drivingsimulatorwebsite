              <h3>Big-scale brainstorming</h3>
              <p>
                We started by exploring full simulator ideas. We looked into methods like linear actuators and other mechanisms that could
                physically move or resist a steering wheel for force feedback. The concepts were exciting, but we realized the complexity and cost
                were high for our time and resources.
              </p>
              <p class="muted">
                Decision: prove the core concept on a smaller scale first.

              <h3>Scaling down to a single rotating motor</h3>
              <p>
                We simplified: instead of multiple actuators, we aimed for one rotating motor output (clockwise and counterclockwise) that could
                represent steering direction. This let us iterate quickly and test the idea with basic parts.

              <h3>Servo/joystick attempts (and why they stalled)</h3>
              <p>
                We attempted to control rotation using a joystick and experimented with different approaches. After multiple failed attempts,
                we recognized a key issue: reversing a DC motor isn’t just a software problem—bidirectional control typically needs an H-bridge.
              </p>
              <p class="muted">
                Lesson: matching the component (servo vs DC motor) to the control goal matters as much as code.

              <h3>Final prototype: toy car on a rotating platform</h3>
              <p>
                Our final demo mounts a toy model car on a rotating motor platform. The platform visibly turns in both directions as our output.
                This gives us a clean, testable proof-of-concept that we can improve later with an H-bridge and stronger mechanical coupling to a wheel.

            <h3>Prototype small first</h3>
            <p>
              Scaling down made progress visible quickly and reduced risk. We could test the idea without building the whole simulator.

            <h3>Hardware matters</h3>
            <p>
              If the goal is bidirectional DC motor motion, you need an H-bridge (or similar driver). Knowing this earlier would’ve saved time.

              Documenting failures helped us converge: each “no” narrowed the path to a working demo.

            Add an H-bridge, tune input mapping for smooth turning, and connect the motor output to an actual steering wheel or gear system to increase torque.
