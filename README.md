# Driving Simulator Prototype (Static Site)

This is a simple static website (no build tools required).

## How to view locally
Option A (quick): open `index.html` in your browser.

Option B (recommended, avoids some browser restrictions):
1. In this folder, run:
   - `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Open:
   - http://localhost:8000

## What to edit
- `about.html` has a ready-to-fill bio + skills + credits section.
- `project.html` has the embedded videos and final build summary.
- `development.html` has the timeline and lessons learned.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repo and upload the entire folder contents.
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Source: Deploy from a branch
4. Branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`
5. Save and wait for the URL to appear.

Note: GitHub Pages is case-sensitive, so keep file names exactly the same.
